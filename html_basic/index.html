    <h2>The Planning Phase</h2>
        <p>Before building my portfolio, careful planning was essential to ensure its effectiveness and clarity.</p>
    <h3>Identifying Objectives</h3>
        <p>I started by defining the goals of my portfolio. Was it to attract clients, secure a job, or simply
            document my projects? Setting clear objectives helped guide my design choices and content structure.</p>
    <h2>Building the Portfolio</h2>
        <p>The actual creation of the portfolio was both challenging and enjoyable.</p>
    <h3>Design and Development</h3>
    <p>I focused on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing design using what i learned at 
        ALX <a href="https://i.ibb.co/gTDZZT8/ALX-Logo-07.png"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gTDZZT8/ALX-Logo-07.png" alt="ALX-Logo-07"></a>. Using tools like Figma for wireframes
        and HTML/CSS for development, I ensured the interface was clean and responsive. Including personal branding
        elements, such as a logo and consistent color schemes, added a professional touch</p>
